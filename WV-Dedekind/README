FOR ALL USERS THIS README MIGHT BE USEFUL TO READ IN ORDER TO COMPILE THE SOURCE CODE FROM THIS JAR CORRECTLY.

This project was developed for Java 7 and will not work for any previous versions of Java. In order to be able to run this code in an environment only supporting Java 6, some changes might be necessary. These changes will mostly be changes in syntax like the use of the diamond operator or multi-catch parameters. Another problem might be the use of the BitSet class, because some of the operations on this BitSet class are not supported in Java 6.

For the MPI-routines, an extra library might be useful to compile the code in an IDE. The library used during development of this project was obtained from open-mpi 1.8.3. The jar containing the library can be found in the "openmpi-version" folder after MPI has been configured with the "--enable-mpi-java" flag. The exact location in the "openmpi-1.8.3" folder should be "openmpi-1.8.3/ompi/mpi/java/java/mpi.jar". To compile this code, open-mpi provides a wrapper for the standard java-compiler. This compiler knows about this library and eliminates the need to add the library to the class path. The compiler can be run with the command "mpijavac Mpi.java" in the terminal with the normal java-flags.
